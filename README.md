# KickBlastJudo Fee Calculator

The KickBlast Judo Fee Calculator application is a Windows desktop solution designed to streamline the process of managing athletes and computing their monthly training costs for KickBlast Judo. Built with C# and Windows Forms, it provides a user-friendly interface where administrators can enter or select an athlete’s details such as name, chosen training plan (Beginner, Intermediate, Elite), current weight, competition weight category, number of competitions in the month, and requested private coaching hours. Upon clicking “Calculate,” the app applies the defined business rules (weekly fees multiplied by four weeks, competition entry fees only for eligible plans, private coaching hour caps, etc.) and instantly displays an itemized preview of training cost, extras cost, and total cost, along with a clear weight-status message indicating whether the athlete is below, at, or above the category limit.

Behind the scenes, the core fee-calculation logic resides in a separate class library (KickBlastJudoLogic), encapsulating methods like CalculateTrainingCost, CalculateExtrasCost, and CompareWeight. This separation ensures that business rules remain centralized, testable, and easily modifiable if fee structures or policies change in the future. Input validation is enforced at the UI layer: text fields, combo boxes, and numeric controls are checked to prevent empty names, missing selections, or out-of-range values, with immediate feedback via MessageBoxes to guide the user and avoid invalid data entering the system.

For persistent management, the application integrates with a SQL Server database containing tables for Plans, WeightCategories, Athletes, CompetitionEntry, and CoachingSession. CRUD operations are exposed through UI buttons: “Add” inserts a new athlete record (and related competition or coaching entries for the current month, respecting eligibility and caps), “Search” queries active athletes by name, “Update” modifies an existing athlete’s details, and “Delete” performs a soft delete by marking an athlete inactive. All database commands use parameterized queries within using blocks to ensure security, proper resource disposal, and maintainability. The DataGridView displays a live list of active athletes along with computed cost columns for the current month, pulling competition counts and coaching hours dynamically from the database, so administrators see at a glance each athlete’s fees without manual calculation.

Robustness is bolstered through systematic debugging and error handling: null-checks guard against missing selections, try/catch blocks capture database exceptions and provide user-friendly messages, and unit tests in the logic library verify that fee computations and weight comparisons behave correctly under various scenarios (e.g., excessive coaching hours or ineligible competition entries). The interface also includes “Clear” and “Cancel” actions for convenience, helping users reset forms or exit cleanly. Throughout development, coding standards (consistent naming, formatting, modular design, XML documentation, secure query patterns) ensure the codebase remains readable and extensible.

In summary, the KickBlast Judo Fee Calculator app empowers administrators to manage athlete data and compute monthly fees accurately and efficiently. Its modular architecture, intuitive UI, and secure database integration reduce manual errors, enforce business rules reliably, and facilitate future enhancements—such as adding new plans, discounting schemes, or reporting features—making it a solid foundation for KickBlast Judo’s operational needs.
